# Barker

This is my degree project, where i decided to create a tinder for dogs using a api to provide the dog images.

## Naming

- Filename: Use PascalCase e.g, `ButtonComponent.jsx`
- Component Naming: Use the filename as the component name e.g, `ButtonComponent`
- Reference Naming: Use PascalCase e.g,

```bash
import ButtonComponent from './ButtonComponent';
```

- Props Naming: Use all lower case.

```bash
<MyComponent color="blue" />
```

- Class & ID's: Use CamelCase e.g, `buttonWrapper`
  - Use BEM naming convention for modifier to change appearance, behavior or state e.g, `buttonWrapper--disabled` or `buttonWrapper_child--disabled`
